            <h1>The Medium Man</h1>
            <h4>“It’s only when you look at an ant through a magnifying glass on a
                sunny day that you realize how often they burst into flames.”
                – Harry Hill
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The style for a lonesome night wandering the streets wanting to look tough
                    enough to not be mugged, yet soft enough to not appear homeless. It's rugged,
                    but drinkable, like a slightly aged glass of wine - elegant, but unrefined.
                </p>
