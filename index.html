                <h1>The Medium Man</h1>
                <h5>“It’s only when you look at an ant through a magnifying glass on a
                    sunny day that you realize how often they burst into flames.”
                    – Harry Hill
                </h5>
                <p>
                    The style for a lonesome night wandering the streets. Tough
                    enough to not be mugged, yet soft enough to not appear homeless. It's rugged,
                    but drinkable, like a slightly aged glass of wine - elegant, but unrefined.
                </p>

                <h1>The Blank Slate</h1>
                <h5>“Cleaning up with children around is like shoveling during a blizzard.”
                    – Margaret Culkin Banning
                </h5>
                <p>
                    A go to cut to get into the Japanese bathhouse of your dreams. Suave &#38; smooth,
                    like a silk wrapped baby piglet. For those who wish to recover from a streak of
                    bad luck, rise up from a sunken pit of despair, or travel back in time to age 11,
                    the hairs hold the struggles of humanity - take them off and remember what
                    sunshine really feels like.

                    – Colonel Sanders
                </h5>
                <p>
                    The style that melts in your mouth, not in your hands. It often doesn't stay
                    long, because it's embarrassing - but it is sure to leave a lasting impression
                    in pictures.

                <h5>“You know you’re getting old when you stoop to tie your shoelaces and wonder what else you could do
                    while you’re down there.”
                    – George Burns
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Classy without context, white hair is the new rage everyone is talking about and
                    people all over the world are racing to one day achieve. It doesn't matter who
                    you are or what color your skin, white facial hair instantly demands respect
                    and can even score you some store discounts.

                <h5>“To those of you who received honours, awards and distinctions, I say well done. And to the C
                    students, I say you, too, can be president of the United States.”
                    – George W. Bush
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Calling all savages, the facial hair style you've been seeking is here. With daft
                    and punk and sugary sweet density, you will have a bro comment or two in no time,
                    though you may be dismissed early at family gatherings and formal events. Fear not,
                    for secret powers of seduction and financial success lie deep, deep, deeep within
                    this beard, deep within...

                <h1>Dangerously Scruffy</h1>
                <h5>“Life is a sexually transmitted disease.”
                    – R. D. Laing
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Vivacious, alluring, temptaciously tantalising. These are all descriptors of a
                    facial hair other than this one. What we have here is a minimal, yet flirtatiously
                    fragrant glimpse into what it looks like when we cut all but some of our hair - leaving
                    just enough to encourage curiosity as to what lies beneath, but transparent, too.
                    True, true.. Rough, scruff n snuff is a joyful compromise between a cat's tongue and the face
                    licked by it.
                    The problem here is no problem, a glass half empty, a vegan without meat, a shadow of what once
                    was, yet - a garden of blossoming bushels to come.
