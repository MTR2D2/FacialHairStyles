                <h1>The Medium Man</h1>
                <h4>“It’s only when you look at an ant through a magnifying glass on a
                    sunny day that you realize how often they burst into flames.”
                    – Harry Hill
                </h4>
                <p>
                    The style for a lonesome night wandering the streets. Tough
                    enough to not be mugged, yet soft enough to not appear homeless. It's rugged,
                    but drinkable, like a slightly aged glass of wine - elegant, but unrefined.

                <h1>The Blank Slate</h1>
                <h4>“Cleaning up with children around is like shoveling during a blizzard.”
                    – Margaret Culkin Banning
                </h4>
                <p>
                    A go to cut to get into the Japanese bathhouse of your dreams. Suave &#38; smooth,
                    like a silk wrapped baby piglet. For those who wish to recover from a streak of
                    bad luck, rise up from a sunken pit of despair, or travel back in time to age 11,
                    the hairs hold the struggles of humanity - take them off and remember what
                    sunshine really feels like.

                <h4>“I’m too drunk to taste this chicken.”
                    – Colonel Sanders
                </h4>
                <p>
                    The style that melts in your mouth, not in your hands. It often doesn't stay
                    long, because it's embarrassing - but it is sure to leave a lasting impression
                    in pictures.
